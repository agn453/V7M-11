# V7M-11
Unix V7M-11 V1.0 for running under emulation using SIMH pdp11

Recently some 5-1/4" RX50 disk-images of the original Unix V7 modified
version for the PDP-11 were made available on the bitsavers
web site at -

http://www.bitsavers.org/bits/DEC/pdp11/floppyimages/rx50/V7M-11-V1.0_6_USR_RX50-QJ083-H3.zip

I've managed to get them installed and running using the SIMH pdp11
simulator (which runs under a wide variety of Windows, Linux and macOS
systems).

SIMH is available at https://github.com/simh/simh

Installation instructions are in the doc/README.md
file.

Unix V7M morphed into Digital's Ultrix-11 for the PDP-11 family, and later
on to the VAX Ultrix-32 version.  These and many other historical and
non-mainstream UNIX systems are available from the Unix Archive
of The Unix Heritage Society at

https://www.tuhs.org/

These old versions are covered by the Caldera License in the
[LICENSE.pdf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agn453/V7M-11/master/LICENSE.pdf)
file.

I have not found any documentation online for Unix V7M-11 V1.0 so the
set-up and install here is based on my experience with later versions
of Unix edition 7 and Ultrix-11.  Raise an issue here on GitHub if
you can point me to their whereabouts.

## Acknowlegment

This version and other enhancements to UNIX(R) version seven were made
by the Unix Systems Engineering Group at DIGITAL by Fred Canter, Bill
Shannon, Jerry Brenner and Armando Stettner.
